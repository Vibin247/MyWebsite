                    My professional career started as one of the first members of the web client team of Mobile Device Manager. I started working on migrating the product to Ember. 
                    To do this I worked alongside back-end developers for the REST APIs and QA teams for testing and releasing the enhancements. The initial plan was to migrate the page as it is.
                    But since we were a dedicated web client team we decided to make the pages better from a user perspective by making the page more alive rather than being static buttons from earlier versions.
                    Since it was the early stages of the migration, I also developed a bundle of reusable components for the web client developers of Mobile Device Manager that are being used to date.

                    Parallelly, I liaised with UI Designers and the Product Management team on numerous features - like Geofencing for Mobile Devices, Custom Configurations for Windows and Mac Computers, Azure and On-premise Active Directory sync to MDM Server - to name very few. Co-ordinated with the back-end team for the development of APIs and developed elegant user interfaces for the features based on the prototypes from UI designers.
                    Post-development, I also assisted the QA team in the timely release of the features.

                    Few of the reusable components developed by me are still being used across teams in Zoho Corporation. Have also conducted knowledge transfer sessions and cataloged the assets, for various teams to use.
