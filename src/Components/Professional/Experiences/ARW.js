                    Post 2 years of working in Mobile Device Manager, I was presented with an opening that would see me as a client module owner. I saw this as a great learning opportunity
                    and decided to migrate to Anti Ransomware and Endpoint Detection &amp; Response.
                    This being a new product for Zoho Corporation, I started studying the current customer expectations and requirements based on existing EDR and Anti Ransomware Products.
                    On completing this study, I narrowed down the scope of the web client for the product under the guidance of various product managers.

                    After fixing the scope of the web client, I built site maps, wireframes, and mockups for the pages of the Anti Ransomware web client.
                    Moving forward, I went on to create the ember engine and develop the web client module of the Anti Ransomware.
                    Currently, working on the development of additional features for the product and collating data for future enhancements.
