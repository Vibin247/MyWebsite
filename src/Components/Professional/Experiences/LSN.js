                    After over 3 years in Zoho Corporation I moved to a different organization that was wokring on something a little different
                    from what ManageEngine was doing. Loadshare Networks Limited empowers the regional logistics SMEs (small and medium
                    enterprises) with <strong>Technology</strong> and <strong>Operations know-how</strong>. The reasons for my decision to 
                    leave Zoho, namely change of industry from EMS and change of tech stack from Ember to React were both satisfied by 
                    this opportunity and made it obvious that this might well be the find for my search.
